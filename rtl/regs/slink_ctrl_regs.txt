# Attribute Override
#
# Attribute overrides are meant to be used to configure S-Link prior to initial start.
#
# A user would go through updating the shadow values then forcing a
#
# It is possible that a user could update attributes during a low power mode, but this 
# should be done on **both** sides of the link. i.e. you use some other side band channel
# to communicate the changes. Do this at your own risk.

SW_ATTR_ADDR_DATA                   RW
  sw_attr_addr                      16'd0                   Address for software based attribute updates
  sw_attr_wdata                     16'd0                   Data for software based attribute updates

SW_ATTR_CONTROLS                    RW
  sw_attr_write                     1'b1                    0 - Perform a read command. 1 - Perform a write command
  sw_attr_local                     1'b1                    0 - Write/Read to far end SLink. 1 - Write/Read to local SLink

SW_ATTR_DATA_READ                   RO
  sw_attr_rdata                     16'd0       RFIFO       Shadow attribute data based on the sw_attr_addr value. *The sw_attr_data_read is actually only the link_clk, so it is advised to set the sw_attr_addr for several cycles prior to reading*

  sw_attr_shadow_update             1'b0        WFIFO       Write a 1 to update the current sw_attr_addr with the current sw_attr_data. If set to local, this will handle a local write, else will create a transation to the other side

SW_ATTR_EFFECTIVE_UPDATE            RW
  sw_attr_effective_update          1'b0        WFIFO       Write a 1 to set the shadow attribute values to the effective values. This should only be used prior to removing swreset for initial config.
