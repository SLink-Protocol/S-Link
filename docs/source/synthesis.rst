Synthesis/PnR
=============
Plan to use `OpenROAD <https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/>`__ for initial synthesis. This will be used to find
any synthesis and/or timing issues up front and for area estimations.

This has been setup, but some of the OpenROAD repos have gone down (as of 8/4/2020) so need to setup again based on
a new setup.
