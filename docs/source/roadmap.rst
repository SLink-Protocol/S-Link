Roadmap
=======

This is a tentative roadmap for the S-Link project. Here are some of the main items I wish to acheive in the next 6-8 months. Based on
feedback and uses, some of these may move around in the timeline.

* AXI Application Layer

  * A configurable AXI application layer that can allow commuinication between chips using AXI
  * Address and Data width would be configurable

* 8/16/32/64 lane support
* 128/130b encoding support
* Phy backpressure support 
* 32bit PHY_DATA_WIDTH support
* CPI Application Layer
* TileLink Application Layer
